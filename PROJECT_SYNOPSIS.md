# National Education Data Platform (NEDP) - Project Synopsis

## Executive Summary

The National Education Data Platform (NEDP) is a comprehensive, AI-powered education management system designed to address the critical challenges of data fragmentation, lack of transparency, and inefficient policy implementation in India's education sector. This unified digital ecosystem integrates multiple stakeholders—students, teachers, institutions, and government administrators—into a single, interoperable platform.

## Problem Statement

India's education system faces several critical challenges:

1. **Data Silos**: Student, teacher, and institutional data scattered across multiple disconnected systems (AISHE, NIRF, NAAC, NSP, AICTE, UGC)
2. **Lack of Transparency**: No unified view of student lifecycle, teacher performance, or institutional quality
3. **Inefficient Scheme Distribution**: Government scholarships and benefits suffer from leakage, duplication, and targeting inefficiencies
4. **Manual Verification**: Time-consuming document verification processes leading to fraud
5. **Policy Impact Assessment**: Inability to measure real-time impact of educational policies
6. **Career Tracking Gap**: No mechanism to track student outcomes post-graduation

## Proposed Solution
