# NEDP - National Education Data Platform

## Overview
This is a Vite + React + TypeScript application for a National Education Data Platform (NEDP). It's an AI-powered education platform that connects students, teachers, institutions, and government to track progress, analyze performance, and drive educational excellence.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **UI Library**: shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication & Database)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Map Integration**: React Leaflet

## Tech Stack
- Vite v5.4.19
- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript
- shadcn-ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase for backend services
- React Router for navigation
- React Leaflet v4.2.1 (downgraded from v5.0 for React 18 compatibility)

## Development Setup
The project has been configured to run in the Replit environment:
- Development server runs on port 5000 (0.0.0.0)
- Uses npm with legacy-peer-deps enabled (due to react-leaflet compatibility)
- Vite configured with HMR on port 5000
- **Important**: Vite is configured with `allowedHosts: ['.replit.dev']` to support Replit's dynamic proxy domains (wildcard pattern allows all *.replit.dev subdomains)

## Recent Changes

### October 1, 2025 - Enhanced Map with Performance Color-Coding
- âœ… **Implemented Multi-Color Performance Markers on Map**
- Added comprehensive performance metrics to 20 institutions nationwide
- Color-coded markers based on performance levels:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green (Excellent)**: Top performers like IITs, NITs (NIRF rank 1-10)
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue (Good)**: Strong institutions (NIRF rank 11-20)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow (Average)**: Moderate performance (NIRF rank 21-50)
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange (Needs Attention)**: Below average, intervention needed (NIRF rank 51-90)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red (Critical)**: Poor performance, urgent action required (NIRF rank 90+, high dropout >20%)
- Each institution now includes:
  - City, Type, Student Count
  - NIRF Rank, Placement Rate, Research Score, Dropout Rate
  - Detailed popup information with all metrics

## Notes
- This project was imported from Lovable.dev
- npm uses `--legacy-peer-deps` for package installation due to react-leaflet peer dependency requirements
- Configured for Replit's proxy environment with proper host settings
- **Important**: react-leaflet was downgraded from v5.0.0 to v4.2.1 to fix "render2 is not a function" error caused by React 18 compatibility issues. v5.0+ requires React 19.
